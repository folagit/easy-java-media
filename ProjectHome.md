# Play Media using Java! #

**With the new JavaFX releases, playing any sort of media -- audio or video -- has become simpler than ever. Implementing these features into a Swing-based desktop application, this project allows users to play audio and video from their own system, or from the Internet.**


---


## Current features -- ##

  * Basic playing and looping of audio files on the user's system through a utility class
  * Basic play-pause-stop functions, using the `javax.sound.sampled` package, for audio files on the user's system through a Swing GUI
  * Basic play-pause-stop functions (currently implemented in JavaFX) for video files on the user's system or on the Internet through a JavaFX GUI


---


## Features being developed -- ##

  1. ### Sound ###
    * Controls like volume, pan, seek position (forward/rewind), etc.
    * Support for playing files on the Internet
  1. ### Video ###
    * Integrating JavaFX video controls with a Swing GUI.
    * Optional controls, as mentioned above, for videos.


---


## Requirements -- ##

  * JDK 7u6 (at least) **OR** JDK 3 with JavaFX
  * For supported audio/video formats, check the Documentation for this project, or go to the [JavaFX Media Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/media/package-summary.html#package_description)
